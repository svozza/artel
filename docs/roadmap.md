# Roadmap

Forward-looking plan for `artel`, written 2026-05-18 after the persistence
slice landed (commit `c5fb93c`). This document is the source of truth for
"what's next" — a fresh agent should be able to pick it up and execute
without re-asking design questions.

ADR-001 (`docs/adr/001-collab-substrate-platform.md`) is the architectural
contract. This roadmap describes the order in which the remaining ADR
commitments get implemented, plus the unknowns that must be resolved
along the way.

## Status

| Crate | State |
|---|---|
| `artel-protocol` | Wire types + Unix-socket transport. Done. |
| `artel-daemon` | Persistent in-memory daemon + `artel-daemon` binary. Done. |
| `artel-client` | Stateless multiplexed client + `artel` CLI binary + `connect_or_spawn`. Done. |
| `artel-fs` | Phase 3a (MVP) shipped: ticket-handout `Workspace` with watcher + applier. Persistence and identity are follow-ups. |

279 tests passing. fmt + clippy clean in both feature modes (with and
without `--all-features`). CI runs ubuntu + macos on stable; workspace
`rust-version` is 1.95.

The substrate is now a real P2P system: two daemons cross-seed addresses
over iroh-gossip, host/joiner messaging round-trips through ack-correlated
gossip frames, sessions persist across restarts, and `artel-fs::Workspace`
mirrors a directory between peers via its own ticket-handout iroh node
(per ADR-001 § "Doc handles across IPC"). What's left is hardening
(persistence for fs, capabilities, observability).

## Phase 1: client auto-spawn — DONE

Shipped `Client::connect_or_spawn(SpawnOptions)` plus daemon-side
stale-socket cleanup and an opt-in `--auto-spawn` flag on the `artel`
CLI. The original design notes follow for reference; for the actual
behaviour, read `crates/artel-client/src/spawn.rs` and the
integration tests in `crates/artel-daemon/tests/auto_spawn.rs`.

### Original design (preserved for reference)

ADR-001 § "Auto-spawned daemon lifecycle" calls for "the first client
connect spawns the daemon if it is not running." Today,
`Client::connect` errors with `Transport(Io)` if the socket is missing.

### Scope

Add `Client::connect_or_spawn(socket_path, daemon_binary)` to
`artel-client`:

1. Try `connect(socket_path)`. If success, done.
2. On `NotFound` / `ConnectionRefused`:
   - Read the PID file (resolved from socket_path's parent).
   - If PID file exists and points at a live process → wait briefly
     and retry connect (race: daemon is still starting up).
   - If PID file is stale or missing → spawn `daemon_binary` as a
     detached child, wait for the socket to appear (with timeout),
     retry connect.
3. Stale-socket recovery: if the socket file exists but is unreachable
   AND the PID file is stale, delete both and spawn fresh.

### Open questions

- **How does the client find the daemon binary?** Three options, ranked:
  1. Caller passes the path explicitly. Cleanest. Recommended.
  2. Search `$PATH` for `artel-daemon`. Convenient; ambiguous if multiple.
  3. Hardcode the install path. Brittle.
- **Detach mechanism on Unix.** `std::process::Command` + double-fork +
  `setsid` is the textbook approach. tokio doesn't ship a "spawn
  detached" helper; do it manually.

### Tests

- Auto-spawn happy path: tempdir, no daemon → `connect_or_spawn`
  succeeds. Verify a daemon process exists with the expected PID.
- Stale-PID recovery: write a fake PID file pointing at PID 1 (or a
  recently-exited child) → succeeds.
- Race-on-startup: two `connect_or_spawn` calls in parallel against a
  cold dir → exactly one daemon ends up running.
- Daemon binary missing → clean error, no spawned process.

### Definition of done

- `Client::connect_or_spawn` works against a real `artel-daemon` binary
  in a tempdir.
- `artel` CLI uses it: `artel list` against a stopped daemon either
  spawns one transparently OR fails with a clear "no daemon, run
  `artel-daemon` first" error (decide during implementation).
- New unit tests + 1 integration test in `artel-client/tests/`.

## Phase 2: iroh integration (multi-slice)

This is the slice that turns artel from a fancy local IPC bus into the
P2P substrate ADR-001 promises. Sliced into 2a..2d to keep blast
radius small.

### 2c-2c — Joiner→host send over gossip — DONE

- `artel-protocol::gossip` v1 → v2: adds
  `GossipBody::SendRequest { req_id, peer, payload }` and
  `GossipBody::SendAck { req_id, result }`. Joiner publishes the
  request; host's bridge picks it up, drives `Registry::send`,
  publishes the ack with the assigned `SessionMessage` (or the
  host's `ProtocolError` on rejection). Joiner correlates via the
  `req_id` Uuid.
- All inter-daemon traffic stays on the gossip topic. No
  dedicated direct-QUIC sidechannel — preserves the option of
  symmetric P2P later (ADR-001 § "Future evolution") since the
  transport doesn't bake in the host-as-sequencer assumption.
- `GossipBridge` gains `pending_sends: HashMap<Uuid, oneshot::Sender>`
  and a `Weak<Registry>` injected at startup via
  `attach_registry`. Per-session `SessionRole { Host, Joiner }`
  drives the inbound forwarder's dispatch. `send_remote` allocates
  a req_id, registers the oneshot, broadcasts the request, awaits
  the ack with a 10s ceiling.
- `Registry::send` now returns the freshly-built `SessionMessage`
  (not just `Seq`) so the bridge can package it into `SendAck.Ok`.
  IPC dispatch reads `.seq` from the result.
- Lazy membership: a joiner's first `SendRequest` doubles as their
  arrival on the host. `Registry::ensure_member` admits + persists
  + emits `PeerJoined` before delegating to `send`. A future slice
  can replace this with an explicit `JoinAnnouncement` frame.
- `SessionError::HostRejected(ProtocolError)` carries the host's
  verdict back through the joiner's IPC response verbatim — a
  joiner that sends after the host closes the session sees
  `UnknownSession` rather than a generic `Internal`.
- 2 new e2e tests:
  - `tests/iroh_joiner_send_fanout.rs`: Bob joins Alice's session,
    Bob sends, Alice and Bob both observe the `Message` with the
    host-assigned seq. Bob's IPC reply carries the same
    `SessionMessage`.
  - `tests/iroh_joiner_send_rejected.rs` (rewritten): Alice
    closes the session, Bob sends → IPC error surfaces the host's
    `ProtocolError::UnknownSession` via the `SendAck.Err` path.
- 230 → 235 tests; clippy + fmt clean both feature modes.

### 2c-2b — Host→joiner one-way gossip fanout — DONE

- New `artel-protocol::gossip` module: `GossipFrame` + `GossipBody`
  envelope (postcard) carrying `SessionMessage` between daemons on
  a topic. v1 wire version; bumped on structural change.
- New `gossip_bridge.rs`: `GossipBridge` owns per-session
  `(GossipSender, forwarder JoinHandle)` pairs. Topic id is
  derived deterministically from session id (first 16 bytes), so
  no topic field needed in tickets.
- `Registry` gains an optional `bridge`. `Registry::host` opens a
  topic; `Registry::send` (host side) publishes each new
  `SessionMessage`; `Registry::join` for a remote ticket
  materialises a local mirror, seeds the host's addr into the
  endpoint's address book, and spawns a forwarder that decodes
  inbound frames into the mirror's log + broadcast.
- `Session` gains a `kind: Local | Remote` discriminator. `Send`
  on a remote session returns `ProtocolError::NotHost` (joiner
  send arrives in 2c-2c with request/reply correlation).
- Joiner-side `subscribe` waits on `GossipReceiver::joined` (15 s
  ceiling) before `JoinSession` returns, so the gossip mesh is
  formed by the time the host can publish. Without it a host that
  sent immediately after the joiner's IPC handshake landed
  silently lost the message.
- 2 e2e tests split across binaries to avoid in-process iroh
  contention: `tests/iroh_gossip_fanout.rs` (host→joiner round
  trip) and `tests/iroh_joiner_send_rejected.rs` (joiner `Send`
  surfaces `NotHost`). Each ~3.4 s.
- 223 → 230 tests; clippy clean both feature modes.

### 2c-2a — Tickets carry host NodeAddr — DONE

- Bumped `TICKET_VERSION` 1 → 2.
- New `WireEndpointAddr { peer_id, relay_url, direct_addrs }`
  in `artel-protocol::ticket`. Iroh-free mirror of
  `iroh::EndpointAddr`. Postcard-encodes inside the ticket body.
- `Registry` gains a `daemon_addr: WireEndpointAddr` field;
  `Daemon::start` snapshots `iroh::Endpoint::addr()` into it via a
  new `iroh_endpoint_to_wire` boundary. Falls back to id-only when
  the daemon is local-only.
- Ticket decode does a self-consistency check
  (`host_addr.peer_id == host_peer_id`) so tampered or
  cross-version tickets surface as `Malformed`.
- 220 → 223 tests (+2 ticket unit tests, +1 e2e identity test).
  No routing yet — that's 2c-2b.

### 2c-1 — iroh-gossip wiring + accept loop — DONE

- iroh-gossip 0.98 added behind the existing `iroh` feature.
- The daemon now stands up an `IrohRuntime` ({ Endpoint, Gossip,
  Router }) at start; `Router::shutdown` cleans up everything,
  including the underlying Endpoint, on the way out.
- `DaemonConfig` gains an opaque `address_lookup:
  Option<AddressLookupOverride>` so integration tests can seed
  `MemoryLookup` for direct localhost dialing without touching the
  n0 relay infrastructure. The override is `pub`-but-uninhabited
  when the `iroh` feature is off so the struct literal stays
  feature-flag-free.
- `Daemon::iroh()` returns the runtime to embedders/tests. No
  `Registry` changes yet — that comes with 2c-2.
- 1 new smoke test (`tests/iroh_gossip_smoke.rs`): two in-process
  daemons cross-seed addresses, subscribe to a topic, exchange a
  payload. Real QUIC handshake, ~3 s.
- 219 -> 220 tests; both feature modes still clean.

### 2b — Real artel:-prefixed ticket format — DONE

- `artel-protocol::ticket`: postcard-encoded payload of
  `{version, session_id, host_peer_id}` wrapped in
  `artel:<base32-nopad-lowercase>`. ~85-char text form.
- `Registry::host` emits the new format; `Registry::join` decodes via
  the new module. Old `artel-local:<uuid>` strings now hit
  `MissingPrefix` → wire `InvalidTicket`.
- 12 ticket unit tests (1 proptest); 208 -> 219 total.
- Deferred to 2c: `NodeAddr` and topic id in the wire payload.
  Wire version slot is reserved so adding them is non-breaking for
  this build (it'll bump TICKET_VERSION).

### 2a — Endpoint + persisted secret key — DONE

- iroh 0.98 added as a default-on `iroh` cargo feature on
  `artel-daemon`. Without the feature the daemon is local-only with a
  synthetic peer id.
- New `iroh_key.rs`: `load_or_create(path)` that reads or generates an
  ed25519 secret with `OsRng`, persists 32 bytes atomically at mode
  0600 next to `daemon.pid` (`~/.artel/iroh.key` by default).
- `Daemon::start` builds an `Endpoint` from the loaded key when
  `DaemonConfig::iroh_key_path` is `Some` and uses the resulting
  `EndpointId` as the wire peer id. `Daemon::run` calls
  `endpoint.close()` on shutdown.
- 11 new tests (8 unit, 3 e2e); 197 -> 208 total.

Today's placeholders:

- `artel-protocol::PeerId` is an opaque `[u8; 32]` (sized for an iroh
  node id but with no iroh dep).
- `artel-protocol::JoinTicket` is `String`. Daemon-side it's
  `"artel-local:<uuid>"`.
- `artel-daemon::server::DaemonConfig::daemon_peer_id` is supplied by
  the caller; `main.rs` derives a synthetic from PID.

### Scope

1. **Add `iroh` as an optional dep on `artel-daemon`.** Behind a
   default-on `iroh` cargo feature so the daemon can still be built
   without it (useful for unit tests, niche embeds).
2. **Spawn an iroh `Endpoint` at daemon startup.** Persist the secret
   key under `~/.artel/iroh.key` (mode 0600). On restart, load the same
   key so the daemon's peer identity is stable. `daemon_peer_id` becomes
   the iroh `NodeId`.
3. **Real ticket format.** A ticket carries:
   - `SessionId` (so the daemon knows which session to route into)
   - Host's iroh `NodeAddr` (so the joiner can dial)
   - A nonce / topic identifier for iroh's gossip layer
   Encoded as base32 (per iroh convention) with a clear `artel:` prefix.
   Old `artel-local:` tickets are rejected with `InvalidTicket`.
4. **Inter-daemon transport.** When daemon A hosts and daemon B joins:
   - B's daemon parses the ticket, dials A's NodeAddr.
   - A QUIC connection is established between the two iroh endpoints.
   - Subsequent `Send` from B's client → B's daemon → iroh → A's daemon
     → A's session log → broadcast to A's subscribers (including any
     of B's clients subscribed via B's daemon).
5. **Daemon-as-host vs daemon-as-relay.** Today only the host daemon
   has the session log. Other peers' daemons hold mirror state per
   ADR-001 (sessions persist locally so reconnection is fast). Mirror
   state is replayable from the host on rejoin via `Subscribe { since }`.

### Big unknowns to resolve up front

- **iroh-gossip vs custom QUIC streams.** iroh has a gossip primitive
  that sounds like a fit but adds dependencies. Direct-streams via
  `Endpoint::accept` may be simpler. Investigate before committing.
- **Connection lifecycle.** When does daemon A drop its connection to
  daemon B? Idle timeout? Explicit Leave? Affects how `Subscribe`
  behaves across daemons.
- **Authoritative log ownership.** Currently the host's daemon assigns
  Seq. With iroh, network round-trip on every `Send` means clients see
  visible latency. Options:
  1. Host-assigns-seq, send is round-trip blocking. Simple, slow.
  2. Local daemon assigns provisional seq, host reconciles. Complex.
  3. CRDT-style log with vector clocks. ADR-001 § "Symmetric P2P"
     territory — explicitly future work.
  Pick (1) for v1; document the latency trade-off; revisit after real
  usage. ADR-001 already commits to the host-as-sequencer model.
- **NAT traversal failures.** iroh handles relay fallbacks but not
  every network is friendly. The transport layer needs to surface
  "couldn't reach the host" cleanly to the joiner.
- **Persistence & iroh state.** The session log already persists. iroh
  connection state (active sessions, peers seen, etc.) is in-process —
  on daemon restart we drop existing peer connections and they
  reconnect. This is fine for v1.

### Tests

- **Single-daemon iroh smoke test.** Daemon A hosts; client connects
  through the daemon; basic Hello/HostSession works with the iroh
  Endpoint up but no peer activity.
- **Two-daemon round-trip.** Spin two daemons in-process with separate
  state dirs and separate iroh endpoints. A hosts, B joins via the real
  ticket, B sends, A's subscriber observes the message.
- **Host disconnect / rejoin.** Daemon B disconnects from A, rejoins,
  Subscribe-since-N replays missed messages.
- **Invalid ticket variants.** Old `artel-local:` ticket → InvalidTicket.
  Truncated base32 → InvalidTicket. Valid format but unreachable
  NodeAddr → distinguishable error.
- **Persisted iroh secret key.** Restart the daemon, NodeId is stable.

### Definition of done

- Two daemons on the same machine (different state dirs) can host/join
  and exchange messages.
- A single daemon can also host and a client (via `artel-client`) can
  send/receive without any inter-daemon hop.
- Tickets are real iroh tickets, not strings. Old tickets rejected.
- Daemon NodeId is stable across restarts.
- `iroh` cargo feature is default-on; without the feature, the daemon
  is local-only and rejects join attempts with a clear error.

## Phase 3: artel-fs (medium-large)

ADR-001 § "Doc handles across IPC" picked the **ticket-handout** shape
for v1: each `Workspace` spawns its own iroh `Endpoint` + `Gossip` +
`Docs` + `Blobs`, distinct from the daemon's. The daemon stays
ignorant of doc semantics; tickets ride the artel session as a
`MessageKind::System` message with action `workspace.ticket`.

### Slice 3a — MVP — DONE

Sub-slices, in order:

- **3a-1** — iroh-docs / iroh-blobs version-compat smoke test. Confirmed
  iroh 0.98 + iroh-docs 0.98 + iroh-blobs 0.100 mate; verified the
  `DocTicket` carries enough `EndpointAddr` info on its own (no
  out-of-band `add_endpoint_info` needed).
- **3a-2** — Pure-logic modules: `keys` (path↔key, NFC, traversal
  guards), `filter` (hardcoded skips + symlink + `.gitignore` + 1 MiB
  cap), `echo_guard` (pending-set + last-published-hash). 26 unit
  tests.
- **3a-3** — `Workspace::host`. Spawns its own iroh node, creates the
  Doc, runs `scan_and_publish_existing`, broadcasts the `DocTicket`
  as a system message. Integration test: a second client subscribed
  to the session observes the ticket.
- **3a-4** — `Workspace::join`. Subscribes to the session, drains
  events until the ticket arrives (15 s ceiling), `import_and_subscribe`
  → wait for `SyncFinished` + `PendingContentReady` → `bulk_export`
  to disk under echo guard. Two-daemon test: Bob's empty dir mirrors
  Alice's two files after `join` returns.
- **3a-5** — Watcher + applier. `notify-debouncer-full` 300 ms
  debounce → `Doc::set_bytes` / `Doc::del`. Applier listens on
  `Doc::subscribe()`, handles `InsertRemote` and `ContentReady` with
  250 ms echo-guard release grace. `Workspace::run` spawns both as
  tokio tasks. Live-edit test: Alice writes → Bob's filesystem
  reflects within ~1 s.
- **3a-6** — End-to-end round-trip test (`tests/round_trip.rs`).
  Bidirectional file edits, gitignore exclusion, and echo-guard
  sanity (1 doc entry per applied key, not 2). Runs the full
  scenario 3 consecutive times to flush out gossip-on-gossip-on-fs
  flakiness.

Storage was memory-only this slice (`Docs::memory()` + blob
`MemStore`); on workspace restart, host re-scans the dir and
re-publishes. Disk-backed Docs/Blobs is a follow-up slice.

### Slice 3b — open follow-ups

- **Disk-backed Docs/Blobs.** `Docs::persistent(path)` +
  `iroh-blobs::store::fs::FsStore`. Workspace state survives across
  restarts. Adds a meaningful disk footprint per workspace; needs a
  cleanup story for orphaned doc dirs.
- **Persistent author identity.** Today `Workspace::host` /
  `join` calls `Authors::author_create` per process; restarting a
  workspace gives it a new author id (cosmetic since we don't
  attribute writes anywhere user-visible, but still wrong).
- **Crash recovery test.** Kill the workspace mid-write, reopen,
  assert no corruption. Pairs with disk-backed.
- **Authoritative `WorkspaceConfig`.** Today filter rules (`.git`,
  `target`, …) are hardcoded. A user-facing config struct lets
  apps add or remove paths.

None block the next phase; pick them up when a real consumer needs
them.

## Phase 4 and beyond

Listed for completeness, no detailed plan yet:

- **Capabilities & auth.** Read-only tickets, signed messages,
  ticket revocation. ADR-001 § "Auth and capability model" — explicitly
  deferred.
- **N-1 protocol-version compatibility.** Today version mismatch is
  fatal. Some scheme that lets a daemon serve clients one version
  behind would smooth upgrades.
- **Wire versioning for gossip frames.** Pre-1.0 we deliberately
  removed the `GossipFrame { version, body }` envelope: both
  daemons rebuild together and an unrecognised body just surfaces
  as `GossipFrameError::Malformed`. Before the first real release
  we'll want a proper capability-negotiation story (or, at minimum,
  re-introduce a leading version byte) so daemons across versions
  can refuse cleanly instead of swallowing garbage. Cheap to add —
  ~30 lines plus tests — and the right time is the v1 cutover.
- **Observability.** Structured metrics endpoint, `collab-daemon list`
  → `artel sessions inspect <id>` deeper view.
- **Symmetric P2P.** ADR-001 § "Future evolution" — drop the
  host-as-sequencer model. Big rethink, not a v2 deliverable.
- **WASM / non-Rust clients.** ADR-001 § "Non-Rust clients become
  possible." Architectural door open; work not scoped.

## Engineering principles, distilled

For a fresh agent picking this up:

1. **Two impls from day one or none.** Don't introduce a trait with
   one implementation. See `feedback_no_speculative_abstractions` in
   memory.
2. **Ship persistence-first paths.** Every mutation persists to disk
   before in-memory state is updated, before fan-out. If the disk
   write fails, the registry stays consistent and the client gets a
   clear `Storage` error.
3. **Tests for every mutation.** Pattern is: store unit tests +
   registry-via-MemoryStore unit tests + e2e tests via real Client.
   No code lands without all three.
4. **Postcard wire enums must be externally-tagged.** Postcard rejects
   `#[serde(tag, content)]`. See memory.
5. **Unix-only for now.** Don't write Windows-aware code; the project
   gates the whole socket layer behind `#[cfg(unix)]` and emits a
   `compile_error!` elsewhere.
6. **Headless first-class.** The daemon must run cleanly under
   systemd/launchd/nohup. CLI output is structured and `--json`-aware
   where it makes sense.
7. **Don't add abstractions beyond what the task requires.** A bug fix
   doesn't need surrounding cleanup. A one-shot operation doesn't need
   a helper.
