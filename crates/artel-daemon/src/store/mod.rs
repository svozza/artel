//! Persistence layer for sessions.
//!
//! [`SessionStore`] is the seam between the runtime
//! `super::session::Registry` and durable storage. The trait is
//! **crate-private** — it is shaped by the operations the registry
//! actually performs, not by speculation about future schemas.
//!
//! - [`FsLogStore`]: on-disk, append-only postcard log + JSON meta.
//!   The shape ADR-001 calls for. Production daemons use this.
//! - [`MemoryStore`]: in-memory, gated `#[cfg(test)]`. Used by unit
//!   tests as the no-persistence baseline so the disk impl has a
//!   reference to compare against. Not present in release builds.
//!
//! A future production-second implementation (e.g. `SQLite`) lands as
//! a drop-in if its needs fit the trait. If they don't, we grow the
//! trait then — with the in-memory test-only impl as a parallel
//! check.

// `redundant_pub_crate` fires because the parent module is already
// `pub(crate)`, so `pub(crate)` items inside are technically as visible
// as plain `pub`. But plain `pub` here trips `unreachable_pub` because
// nothing exports them publicly. The two lints are mutually
// contradictory inside crate-private modules; we allow the redundancy.
